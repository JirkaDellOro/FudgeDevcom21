# FudgeDevom21: Solar System
Example program to demonstrate [FUDGE](https://jirkadelloro.github.io/FUDGE/) during the session at the devcom21.  
The program displays a solar system reduced to the sun, the earth and the moon. The earth orbits around the sun, the moon around the earth. Life on earth makes noise. You can orbit the camera around, zoom in and out and click on the celestial bodies to get more information and adjust the speed of the passing of time. This example is sufficient to demonstrate core principles of FUDGE like  

- the editor
- the setup of a FUDGE-project
- the scene graph
- the component entity system
- scripting with and without components
- the mutator principle
- the user interface system
- and much more...
